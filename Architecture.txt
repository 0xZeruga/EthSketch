Architecture

Set up docker.
Docker starts an Ethereum Node and keeps it running.
Docker also sets up all parts necessary for front.

The Ether Node runs the Ethereum Blockchain and manages all logic that happens in solidity

JavaScript draws the UI and enables user to highlight and chose colours for pixels, aswell as confirm transactions.
When the User triggers a transaction, Javascript sends out  a hashstring to Swarm.
Swarm returns the stored static address where the Ether  is stored.
JavaScript inserts the address as the recieving address of the Metamask transaction.

Metamask then checks whether the sender either can afford or not afford the transaction.
If the transaction is successful the data is parsed through Solidity's logic.
Solidity finds the pixel, edit its color and then sends it to Swarm.
Swarm saves pixelid/coordinate, color and owner address.
Javscript regularly retrives the data from swarm (with URL access) and draws the canvas correspondingly.
