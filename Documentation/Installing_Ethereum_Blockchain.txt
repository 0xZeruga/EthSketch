Installing Ethereum Blockchain

sudo npm install -g truffle
truffle
truffle version (should be at least v4.x.x)
npm install -g ganache-cli
npm i -g how-to-npm
how-to-npm

//Follow login procedure and then Start a Project
//Enter default values within parenthesis under Start a Project

npm install --save-dev webpack //this updates your webpack from 2.4 to 4

ganache-cli

//Your Node.js cmd is now listening to the blockchain hosted on a localhost port.
//We can now set up what is supposed to run through Truffle

Open a second terminal
Cd to repo
truffle help (will display a bunch of options)
truffle init (to start a new project)
truffle compile (to check compilation after making code changes)
truffle deploy (runs migrations to deploy contract) //DO NOT REMOVE MIGRATION FILES
truffle test (runs JS and Sol tests)

I recommend creating a testfolder where you run
truffle unbox  (it will create an example project)

Have fun!
